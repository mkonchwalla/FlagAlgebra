# FlagAlgebra
Repository for my Masters Thesis which automates the calculations for Razborov's Flag Algebra Method. The main style of problem focused in my Thesis were Turan problems in Extremal 

Automates the process for calculating the Cauchy-Schwartz coeffiecients. See the Thesis for more information on the significance of these. 

There are classes for flags, graphs, and defined multiplication operations between graphs in the quotient space. 
The main
